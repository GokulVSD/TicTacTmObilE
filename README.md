# CSE535_P2_TicTacToe_Group_22

## Overview

This project is a mobile application that implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, allowing a human player to play against an AI on Android or iOS platforms. The game uses the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine the AI's moves. Additionally, the app supports various difficulty modes and the option to store game history on the device.

## Features:

1. **Human vs AI**: The user can play against the AI with three difficulty modes (Easy, Medium, Hard).
2. **Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**: The AIâ€™s moves are determined using this algorithm to optimize performance and reduce computation time.
3. **Game History**: Store the results of past games, including the date, winner, and difficulty mode.
4. **Difficulty Modes**:
   - Easy: AI takes random actions.
   - Medium: AI takes random actions 50% of the time and optimal actions the other 50%.
   - Hard: AI plays optimally in every turn.

## Hardware Requirements:

- **Android or iOS Device**:
  - Android: A phone running Android with Android Studio installed for development.
  - iOS: An iPhone with Xcode installed for development.
- **Computer**:
  - For Android development: Ubuntu, Windows, or Mac.
  - For iOS development: MacOS is required.
- **USB Cable**: To connect your phone to the computer unless you're using an emulator.
- **Secondary Device**: A second phone or a camera for demo purposes and video recording.

## Software Requirements:

- **Android Studio**: Required for Android development.
- **Xcode**: Required for iOS development.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.
- **GitHub**: A private GitHub repository is used to submit the project.

## Setup Instructions:

1. Clone the repository using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-link.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio (for Android) or Xcode (for iOS).
3. Install any required dependencies through Android Studio or Xcode.
4. Connect your device or set up an emulator.
5. Run the project using the "Run" option in your IDE.

## Running the App:

1. **Install the APK (for Android)**:
   - Build and install the APK on your Android device.
   - Run the app and start a new game from the main menu.
2. **Running on iOS**:
   - Open the project in Xcode.
   - Build and deploy the app to your iPhone.

## Additional Features (Optional Extra Credit):

1. **Bluetooth Multiplayer**: Connect two devices via Bluetooth to allow human vs. human gameplay.
2. **Human vs Human on Same Device**: Two players can alternate turns on the same device.

## Contribution Guidelines:

Each team member has worked on different aspects of the project. To ensure collaboration, we used Git for version control. Every member worked on individual branches and merged their code after reviews. Frequent and descriptive commits are a must.

## Submission Details:

- **Source Code**: Submitted via GitHub repository.
- **Demo Video**: Demonstration video uploaded to YouTube, link included in the project report.
- **Project Report**: A technical document explaining the implementation details (using the IEEE Transactions format).
